# video-effect-processor
a suite of tools, algorithms, pipelines that affect video streams in certain unique and interesting ways. built primarily using python and opencv

currently, there's 3 different effects: a pixelation filter, a moving edge detection filter, and an image to ascii converter.
i plan to add a way to import videos into the program rather than simply feed my webcam footage into it, and i will also add more effects and iron out all of the bugs that are currently present in the program!
